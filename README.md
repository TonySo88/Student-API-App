# Student-API-App

Hello, world. This applicaiton is simple in terms of functionality and has a stronger focus on fundamental JavaScript. It is a straight forward application that makes a GET request and receives some JSON regarding students and their information. I mapped and filtered through the data to display them in different fashions. I also created a search form that narrows down the students based on how many letters are typed. I am especially proud of that feature. Displaying each student's avatar was another fun task that I completed.

I hope you enjoy!
